# Artur Pajak - Homepage

## [Demo](https://arturpajak.github.io/Homepage/)

This is my first attempt to make a working website, I have started from scratch, not knowing anything about coding.

### Briefly about the project
- I made navigation that links with the first 3 sections of the website. Clicking each one sends the user to the corresponding section.
- I placed a button above every section that allows the user to hide/show the corresponding section.
- I made a table listing my favourite movies.
- The last button allows the user to change the background for brighter and then back to a darker version.
- I have tried to use as much as I have learned, preserving clean code on the way
